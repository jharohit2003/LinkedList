# 📚 Linked List Implementation in Java

This repository contains a simple **Linked List implementation in Java**, demonstrating the fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.  
It serves as a reference for beginners learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Create and initialize a Linked List
- Insert nodes at the beginning, end, or specific position
- Delete nodes by value or position
- Search for elements in the list
- Traverse and display elements
- Well-structured and beginner-friendly code

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core concepts, OOP, DSA)

## 📖 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LinkedList-Java.git
   cd LinkedList-Java
Compile the Java files:

bash
Copy code
javac src/*.java
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
java src.Main
📸 Example Output
rust
Copy code
Linked List after insertion: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null
After deleting 20: 10 -> 30 -> null
Element 30 found at position 2
📌 Future Enhancements
Implement Doubly Linked List

Implement Circular Linked List

Add Unit Tests
